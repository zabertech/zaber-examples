# Packaging ZML with PyInstaller

*By Martin Zak*

This example demonstrates how to package a Python script that uses Zaber Motion Library with PyInstaller.
The script itself in `main.py` is a simple motion example.

## PyInstaller

PyInstaller is a tool to package Python scripts into standalone executables.
When used with Zaber Motion Library the shared library (.dll, .so, or .dylib) file must be explicitly included in the package.
The command below taken from `build.bat` demonstrates how to include the library.

```ps1
pyinstaller --onefile --add-binary ".venv\Lib\site-packages\zaber_motion_bindings\zaber-motion-lib-windows-amd64.dll;zaber_motion_bindings" main.py
```

## Dependencies

- The example is made for Windows, but it can be easily adapted for other platforms.
- Python 3.10 or newer
- The script uses `venv` to manage virtual environment and dependencies.
- The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Running the Script

Open the `main.py` file and replace the serial port name with the one you are using.
Then run the script:

```ps1
.\setup_venv.bat
.\run.bat
```

## Building the Executable

To build the executable:

```ps1
.\setup_venv.bat
.\build.bat
```

You'll find the distributable executable `main.exe` in the `dist` directory.
You can test it by running:

```ps1
.\dist\main.exe
```
