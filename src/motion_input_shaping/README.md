# Input Shaping for Motion Control Vibration Reduction

*By Graham Kerr and Jay Leong*

This repository contains code to complement our article [Input Shaping for Motion Control Vibration Reduction](https://www.zaber.com/articles/input-shaping-for-vibration-reduction). Input shaping algorithms described in the article are implemented in Python, along with classes allowing them to be easily used with Zaber stages via the [Zaber Motion Library](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py) API.

## Hardware Requirements

This code is designed to run on devices with [Zaber](https://www.zaber.com/) controllers. However, the underlying math could be utilized on almost any motion controller.

Notes:
- This code requires Zaber devices with firmware version 7.25 or higher.
- [measure_vibration_test.py](measure_vibration_test.py) and [shaping_comparison_test.py](shaping_comparison_test.py) scripts require a stage with a direct reading encoder to measure the resultant system vibrations.

## Dependencies

### Python

The script uses `pipenv` to manage virtual environment and dependencies:

    python3 -m pip install -U pipenv

The dependencies are listed in the [Pipfile](Pipfile).

## Usage

Most of the files in this repository are designed to be imported and reused in other programs rather than being run directly.
However, most Python files contain example code at the bottom demonstrating how to properly use the classes defined in that file.
Running the Python file directly will run the example code.

The `shaped_axis.py` and `shaped_axis_stream.py` files each contain an implementation of input shaping using different methods. The ideal choice will depend on the system and application it is being used for. Details on the benefits of each method are provided below in the [ShapedAxis Class](#shapedaxis-class) and [The ShapedAxisStream Class](#shapedaxisstream-class) sections.

Before running `measure_vibration_test.py` or `shaping_comparison_test.py`:
- Edit `COM_PORT`: the serial port that your device is connected to.
For more information on how to identify the serial port,
see [Find the right serial port name](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/docs/guides/find_right_port).
- In `shaping_comparison_test.py`, the shaper mode and settings should be changed to suit a particular system. More details on how to configure the shaper is provided in the sections below.

To run the example code:

    cd src/motion_input_shaping
    pipenv install
    pipenv run python measure_vibration_test.py
    pipenv run python shaping_comparison_test.py

A brief overview of the primary files:
- [shaped_axis.py](shaped_axis.py) - Contains the `ShapedAxis` class to perform shaping using the algorithm described in [A Generic ZV Algorithm](https://www.zaber.com/articles/input-shaping-for-vibration-reduction#A_Generic_ZV_Algorithm). This method of shaping attempts to cancel the impulse from acceleration by changing the timing and magnitude of the deceleration.
- [shaped_axis_stream.py](shaped_axis.py) - Contains the `ShapedAxisStream` class to perform input shaping using [streams](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/docs/guides/streams) to send a trajectory generated by convolving impulses with trapezoidal motion. This method is capable of using more complex shapers for better robustness.
- [shaping_comparison_test.py](shaping_comparison_test.py) - Contains code for testing the `ShapedAxis` class. The script performs moves with and without input shaping and plots the resulting performance comparison.
- [measure_vibration_test.py](measure_vibration_test.py) - Contains code for determining a system's vibration parameters. A movement is performed, plotted, and then overlaid with a theoretical damped vibration curve.

Helper files:
- [plant.py](plant.py) - Contains the `Plant` class which contains parameters defining the target vibration in the system that the input shaper will try to reduce.
- [zero_vibration_shaper.py](zero_vibration_shaper.py) - Contains the `ZeroVibrationShaper` class, which is a basic mathematical implementation of a zero vibration input shaping algorithm through changing deceleration.
- [zero_vibration_stream_generator.py](zero_vibration_stream_generator.py) - Contains the implementation of shapers and generate the information required to execute a trajectory through a stream.
- [damped_vibration.py](damped_vibration.py) - Contains the `DampedVibration` class, which is a basic mathematical implementation of a theoretical damped vibration response curve.
- [step_response_data.py](step_response_data.py) - Contains the `StepResponseData` class, which is a helper class used for perfoming a move with a Zaber axis while capturing position data via the onboard scope. It is used in the other testing scripts.

### ShapedAxis Class

This class performs shaping by attempting to cancel the impulse from acceleration by changing the timing and magnitude of the deceleration.

This simplified method works well for short moves that are completed in a low number of vibration periods. The vibration cancellation only occurs while decelerating meaning the oscillation will persist during the move and only be reduced when coming to stop. This method becomes less effective with longer moves due to the errors that are accumulating in the time between acceleration and deceleration.

Performing a move only requires sending a maximum of 3 additional commands so communication overhead is low and will only add a short delay to the start of the move.

The general class usage is shown below.

Importing the class (Python):

```python
from shaped_axis import ShapedAxis
from plant import Plant
```

Initalization (Python):

```python
plant = Plant(resonant_frequency, damping_ratio)
shaped_axis_var = ShapedAxis(axis, plant)
```
- The `axis` parameter is the [`Axis`](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/axis) or [`Lockstep`](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/lockstep) class instance that the `ShapedAxis` class will perform input shaped moves on.
- See [here](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/docs/tutorials/code) for a basic tutorial on how to initialize the `Axis` class.
- The `plant` parameter is an instance of the `Plant` class which defines the vibration that the input shaper is targeting.
  - The `Plant` class has `resonant_frequency` and `damping_ratio` properties that define the target vibration frequency in Hz and damping ratio at which the input shaping algorithm will remove vibration.

Class Methods:
- `move_absolute_shaped()` - Moves to an absolute position using a trajectory shaped for the target resonant frequency and damping ratio. Similar format to the [Axis.move_absolute()](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/axis#_moveabsolute) command.
- `move_relative_shaped()` - Moves to a relative position using a trajectory shaped for the target resonant frequency and damping ratio. Similar format to the [Axis.move_relative()](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/axis#_moverelative) command.
- `move_max_shaped()` - Moves to the max limit using a trajectory input shaped for the target resonant frequency and damping ratio. Similar format to the [Axis.move_max()](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/axis#_movemax) command.
- `move_min_shaped()` - Moves to the min limit using a trajectory input shaped for the target resonant frequency and damping ratio. Similar format to the [Axis.move_min()](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/axis#_movemin) command.
- `get_max_speed_limit()` - Gets the current velocity limit for which shaped moves will not exceed. Allows user specified units.
- `set_max_speed_limit()` - Sets the velocity limit for which shaped moves will not exceed. Allows user specified units.
- `reset_max_speed_limit()` - Resets the velocity limit for shaped moves to the device's existing maxspeed setting. This is the default limit and is automatically set when the class is created.
- `reset_deceleration()` - Resets the trajectory deceleration to the value that existed when the `ShapedAxis` class was first initialized.

__Important Notes:__
- All shaped movement commands have an optional acceleration parameter. If this parameter is not specified, the current acceleration setting will be queried from the device prior to performing each move. For maximum speed it is recommended to specify this value as it reduces communication overhead.
- Shaped movement commands will adjust the [motion.decelonly](https://www.zaber.com/protocol-manual#topic_setting_motion_decelonly) setting. The `reset_deceleration()` method can be used to restore this value. No other trajectory settings are adjusted.

### ShapedAxisStream Class

This class uses [streams](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/docs/guides/streams) to send more complicated input shaped trajectories that are generated by convolving shaper impulses with trapezoidal motion. The most basic shaper is the ZV shaper which is described in [Zero Vibration Shaping](https://www.zaber.com/articles/input-shaping-for-vibration-reduction#Zero_Vibration_Shaping).

The shapers implemented through this method can operate over any range of move distances. They independently remove vibrations during acceleration and deceleration so the smoothness during the move is also improved. More complex shaper types can also be used to create a shaper with a wider frequency window to make it more tolerant to errors in the system's resonant frequency. For a more detailed explanation of shaper types the benefits of each, please see [input_shaper_types.md](input_shaper_types.md).

Performing a shaped move using streams requires 3 commands to be sent for each acceleration step in order to set the speed limit, acceleration, and end position of each segment. There are also commands to initialize the stream. This communication overhead will cause a delay between requesting a move and the move starting. The number of acceleration steps increases with more complex shapers resulting in longer delays.

The general class usage is shown below.

Importing the class (Python):

```python
from shaped_axis_stream import ShapedAxisStream
from zero_vibration_stream_generator import ShaperType
from plant import Plant
```

Initalization (Python):

```python
plant = Plant(resonant_frequency, damping_ratio)
shaped_axis_var = ShapedAxisStream(axis, plant, ShaperType.ZV, stream_id)
```
- The axis parameter is the [`Axis`](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/axis) or [`Lockstep`](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/lockstep) class instance that the `ShapedAxisStream` class will perform input shaped moves on.
- See [here](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/docs/tutorials/code) for a basic tutorial on how to initialize the `Axis` class.
- The `plant` parameter is an instance of the `Plant` class which defines the vibration that the input shaper is targeting.
  - The `Plant` class has `resonant_frequency` and `damping_ratio` properties that define the target vibration frequency in Hz and damping ratio at which the input shaping algorithm will remove vibration.

Class Properties:
- `shaper_type`: Type of the input shaper to use. Defaults to `ShaperType.ZV` if unspecified. Available shaper types are defined in the `ShaperType` enumeration class in [zero_vibration_stream_generator.py](zero_vibration_stream_generator.py). More details on the different input shaper types can be found in  [input_shaper_types.md](input_shaper_types.md).
- `stream_id`: Identifier number for the stream on the device. This defaults to 1 if unspecified. This is necessary if multiple streams are being used on a single device in order to avoid a conflict. For example, when performing input shaping in stream mode on two separate axes on a controller, each axis will need its own stream, so a different id needs to be specified when configuring each class instance.

Class Methods:
- `move_absolute_shaped()` - Moves to an absolute position using a trajectory shaped for the target resonant frequency and damping ratio. Similar format to the [Axis.move_absolute()](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/axis#_moveabsolute) command.
- `move_relative_shaped()` - Moves to a relative position using a trajectory shaped for the target resonant frequency and damping ratio. Similar format to the [Axis.move_relative()](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/axis#_moverelative) command.
- `move_max_shaped()` - Moves to the max limit using a trajectory input shaped for the target resonant frequency and damping ratio. Similar format to the [Axis.move_max()](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/axis#_movemax) command.
- `move_min_shaped()` - Moves to the min limit using a trajectory input shaped for the target resonant frequency and damping ratio. Similar format to the [Axis.move_min()](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/api/py/ascii/axis#_movemin) command.
- `get_max_speed_limit()` - Gets the current velocity limit for which shaped moves will not exceed. Allows user specified units.
- `set_max_speed_limit()` - Sets the velocity limit for which shaped moves will not exceed. Allows user specified units.
- `reset_max_speed_limit()` - Resets the velocity limit for shaped moves to the device's existing maxspeed setting. This is the default limit and is automatically set when the class is created.

__Important Notes:__
- All shaped movement commands have an optional acceleration parameter. If this parameter is not specified, the current acceleration setting will be queried from the device prior to performing each move. For maximum speed it is recommended to specify this value as it reduces communication overhead.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If you encounter an error when running one of the example scripts, check the Serial Port number (ex. COM5) using [Zaber Launcher](https://software.zaber.com/zaber-launcher/download).
