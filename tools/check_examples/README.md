# Check Examples
This script checks that all the example directories have the required files,
and performs linting as required for various languages.

For Python examples, the script looks for `Pipfile` or `requirements.txt`
and uses `pipenv` or `venv` to create virtual environments and install dependencies as needed.

This script is also used by GitHub Actions,
and called from `.github/workflows/check_examples.yml`

## Dependency
