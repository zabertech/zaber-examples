# GUI PyQt6

*By Nathan Paolini*

This basic GUI allows the user to control and monitor stage position

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10 or newer
- The script uses `venv` to manage virtual environment and dependencies.
- The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Configuration

Edit the following constants in the script to fit your setup before running the script:

- `SERIAL_PORT`: the serial port that your device is connected to.
For more information on how to identify the serial port,
see [Find the right serial port name](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/docs/guides/find_right_port).
- `AXIS_NUM`: the axis number of your stage.

## Running the Script

Connect a stage first.

### Windows

To setup `venv`, run `setup_venv.bat` in the `python` folder.

To run the script:

    cd src\gui_pyqt6
    .venv\Scripts\python stage_pos_gui.py

### Linux / MacOS

To setup `venv`:

    cd src/gui_pyqt6
    python3 -m venv .venv
    .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the script:

    .venv/bin/python stage_pos_gui.py

## Editing the GUI

The GUI can be editted using QT Designer, which is included with the PyQt6-tools package.

To launch QT Designer, which can be used to modify the `ui_raw.ui` file, run this command:

Windows:

    .venv\Scripts\pyqt6-tools.exe designer

Linux/MacOS:

    .venv/bin/pyqt6-tools designer

After modifying the `ui_raw.ui` file, the first time the GUI is run the `ui_raw.ui` file will
be compared to the `ui_raw_compare.ui` file, the script will see differences, and it will then
generate a new `ui.py` file by running `UI_py_convert.bat` (this process will need modifications for Linux/Mac).
The benefit of this setup compared to just using the `ui_raw.ui` file directly is that the generated `ui.py` file
provides correct type hints for PyQt objects.

## Script Purpose

This script launches a GUI that provides live output of a stage's position and allow the user to move the stage.
This is meant to be a starter GUI that functionality can be added to.
